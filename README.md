# RandomSnippets

This is just a bunch of random code snippets I've created. Most serve no purpose other than trying to figure out complex tasks.

### clock
I had a conversation with a coworker years ago about metric vs imperial. It led me to wonder why time wasn't in metric in... every country besides the US. So, I created a clock that told time in metric. This clock breaks time down into 100 hours in a day, 100 minutes in an hour, 100 seconds in a minute.

### color
This is a small program that chooses the closest "web safe" color based on the hex color you imput. It calculates the difference in decimal between the color you supplied and each of the web safe colors. It then returns the color with the least calculable difference.

### fibonacci
This was an attempt at "golfing" the fibonacci sequence. Therefore, it is very ugly and probably not very efficient.

### life
A simple Conway's game of life. Screen is only 20x20.

### powerball
I threw together a quick function that loops through all of the powerball data (up to this point) and tallies how many times each number has been called. It then spits out the 5 most likely numbers as well as the most likely powerball number to be called.

### randomString
When creating passwords, I generally use online password generators. I read something one time about the possibility that these web apps may store the passwords that they generate. So, I thought it might be a good idea to roll my own. This is a CLI app that once executed, asks you which types of characters you would like and then how long you would like the password to be. It then outputs a random string that fits your criteria.

##### future
Keep an eye on this. I'll be adding more in the future.
